                <p className='text-justify text-[10px] lg:text-[16px] text-[#666]  py-[5px]'>I come from a small, loving, and supportive family that has always been the backbone of my life. We live in the Sherpur district, part of the Mymensingh division in Bangladesh. My father's name is Atindra Mankhin, and my mother is Anoti Rangsha. They have worked hard throughout their lives to provide for our family and instilled in us the values of honesty, discipline, and compassion. My father has always been a source of wisdom and strength, while my mother has been the heart of our home, nurturing us with her care and kindness.</p>
                <p className='text-justify text-[10px] lg:text-[16px] text-[#666]  py-[5px]'>I have one younger brother, Abhijeet Rangsha, who is full of energy and ambition. We share a strong bond, and I always try to guide and support him in his journey, just as he supports me in mine. Our family believes in staying close, helping each other during tough times, and celebrating even the smallest moments of joy together.</p>
                <p className='text-justify text-[10px] lg:text-[16px] text-[#666]  py-[5px]'>Growing up in such a warm and caring environment has had a huge impact on my personal and professional life. My family continues to motivate me every day to work hard, stay humble, and keep pushing forward toward my goals.</p>
