        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p className='text-justify text-[10px] lg:text-[16px] text-[#666]  py-[5px]'>
          My name is Paros Rangsha, and I am a passionate and detail-oriented Front-End Web Developer with over five years of hands-on experience in building responsive, user-friendly websites and web applications. I specialize in crafting clean and efficient code using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. With a strong understanding of web standards and modern development practices, I take pride in creating interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also accessible, fast, and functional across all devices.</p>
        <p className='text-justify text-[10px] lg:text-[16px] text-[#666] py-[5px]'>
          I am originally from the Sherpur district in the Mymensingh division of Bangladesh. Growing up in a culturally rich and close-knit community has shaped my values of hard work, dedication, and respect for others. I completed my Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) and have always had a strong passion for technology and design. That passion eventually led me to pursue web development as a career.

        <p className='text-justify text-[10px] lg:text-[16px] text-[#666] py-[5px]'>
          In addition to my web development journey, I have also gained professional experience working in the textile industry. For the past five years, I have been serving as an Officer in ERP and Final Inspection at Paramount Textile PLC, a well-established private company in Bangladesh. In this role, I am responsible for managing ERP-related tasks and ensuring that final product inspections meet strict quality standards. This experience has taught me the importance of precision, attention to detail, and working efficiently within structured systems—skills that I carry into my web development projects.

        <p className='text-justify text-[10px] lg:text-[16px] text-[#666] py-[5px]'>
          I come from a supportive family that inspires me every day. I’m the son of Atindra Mankhin and Anoti Rangsha, and I have one younger brother named Abhijeet Rangsha. My family has been a source of motivation in my professional journey, and their encouragement continues to push me toward my goals.
        </p>
        <p className='text-justify text-[10px] lg:text-[16px] text-[#666] py-[5px]'>
          Looking ahead, I aspire to work on larger, more complex web projects that challenge my creativity and technical knowledge. I am open to collaboration, freelance opportunities, or joining a forward-thinking team where I can contribute meaningfully and continue to grow as a developer.
        </p>
        <p className='text-justify text-[10px] lg:text-[16px] text-[#666] py-[5px]'>
          In everything I do, I aim to combine creativity with logic, and passion with precision. Whether I’m coding a website or reviewing data for inspection, I strive to deliver my best work with honesty and dedication.</p>
